# Secification

The AMQP specification is loaded before any communication to the server happens. The specifications included in bramqp are provided by [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/protocol.html) and [Qpid](https://github.com/apache/qpid/tree/trunk/qpid/specs). 

In addition to this xml specification, a list of valueTypes is needed.  This list is maintained in [valueTypes.js](../lib/valueTypes.js).
